        <h3 class="text-center">MORE ABOUT THE CHURCH</h3>
<p>Birth of the church is a good metaphor for the day of Pentecost although the Bible does not use it.  There were of course essential previous events–the birth and earthly ministry of Jesus, and what directly precedes Pentecost.  That is the death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. The resurrected Jesus himself orders the apostles to stay in Jerusalem for the coming of the Holy Spirit.  It is then that they will receive the “power” that they need to carry out their mission (Acts  1.8).  It is an empowerment of a group, not of isolated followers.

    Think of the difference it would be if Jesus instead had ordered every one of them to go to their individual homes, and there they would receive the Holy Spirit.  Even if they would receive this Spirit at the same time, it would be quite different.  They wouldn’t receive it as a body, as an empowered group. Instead the church is founded; they are a group; they are together. Each member nevertheless is a significant part of it.  They are a body gathered together, but each member receives the gift of the Holy Spirit

    Similarly, Paul calls the “church” "the body of Christ” and each one “individually members of it” (1 Corinthians 12.27-28).  This body of Christ is the group that was born at Pentecost where the gift of the Spirit was first received.  Paul has just said that this body of Christ is where “to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good” ( 1 Cor. 12.7).  It is a group for the effective work of the church, but the gifts for that health and mission of the body are given to the individual members.  Each one has the flame.

    Where did this begin?  It began at Pentecost.  Was there ever a greater birth day?</p>
