            <p>A sacrament is a Christian rite recognized as of particular importance and significance. There are various views on the existence and meaning of such rites. Many Christians consider the sacraments to be a visible symbol of the reality of God, as well as a channel for God's grace.</p>

            <p>At the General Audience on Wednesday, Pope Francis turned his gaze to the prayer life of the early Church, as he continued his catechesis on prayer.

                “The Church’s first steps in the world were interspersed with prayer,” the Pope said. The writings of the New Testament, and especially the Acts of the Apostles, give us “the image of an active Church on the move, yet which gathered in prayer finds the basis and impulse for missionary action.”</p>

            <p>It was 26 November 1971 when Pope Paul VI, a long-time friend of the Pauline Family, left the Vatican to make a rare private visit. His destination was the bedside of Father James Alberione, Founder of the Pauline Family, who died later that day at 6:30pm. The words Pope Paul had spoken just over two years earlier, on 28 June 1969, when he conferred on Alberione the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice cross, say everything that can be said about this great man.</p>

            <img src="bootstrap/images/img_19.png" class="rounded-3" alt="error" width="450" height="250">

            <p>Ahead of World Mission Day this Sunday, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle – the prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples – says the zeal that inspired the Apostles came from the experience of the power of God’s love in Jesus.

                “They experienced the friendship of Jesus, they heard His Beatitudes, they saw how the poor received the good news, they saw how Jesus touched the sick.”

                Speaking at a press conference in the Vatican, Cardinal Tagle said that a “gripping… deep experience” of Jesus leads to a “state of mission” that is at the same time a reflection of gratitude. Missionaries, he said, bear the “gospel of compassion and hope” fuelled by gratitude.</p>

            <p>In the aftermath of the military coup in Sudan, the bishops of Sudan and South Sudan have expressed dismay that the African nation has slipped back to dictatorship and deadly unrest.

                General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on October 25 seized power from a transitional government, detaining Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, as well as several government officials and political leaders. He dissolved the military-civilian Sovereign Council, the country’s collective head of state, that had been established to guide the country to democracy following the overthrow of long-ruling military autocrat Omar al-Bashir in the aftermath of the ‘Revolution’ or the 2018-19 popular uprising.</p>
